# TextAnalysisIntro
These materials form a beginner workshop on the basics of quantitative textual analysis in the R programming language.

This workshop was originally offered during the Fall 2018 semester and again in Spring 2019 and Spring 2020 at Rutgers University-New Brunswick through the [New Brunswick Libraries Graduate Specialists program](https://libguides.rutgers.edu/graduatespecialist/) and the [Rutgers DH Initiative](http://dh.rutgers.edu/).

## File Guide
**TextAnalysisIntro.Rmd** Master .Rmd file for user participation in the workshop, to run or edit code as desired; used to generate .pdf file.

**TextAnalysisIntro.pdf** This .pdf file is best for viewing the workshop or following along outside of an R or RStudio environment; it contains all code as well as sample outputs and figures.

**sample_texts/** A directory containing sample texts for participants - though users are welcome to use their own texts saved in .txt format. **grandissimes.txt**, the 1879 novel *The Grandissimes* by George Washington Cable, is the default used for demonstration in the .pdf and .Rmd files.

## Setup for Beginners
If you’re new to R, you’ll need to set up access in one of two ways first. The standard method is to [download R itself](https://cran.rstudio.com/) for whichever operating system you're using and then [download RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that makes working in R clearer by adding a text editor for writing or loading R code and a workspace for viewing data in memory.

If you want a fast, easy way to give R a try with a stable internet connection, you can use [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/). This browser version of RStudio looks and functions just like the desktop version, and it saves data between sessions too. All it takes is a Google account to log on. You can even clone this workshop repository directly into your RStudio Cloud workspace by clicking the arrow next to the “New Project” button, selecting “New Project from Git Repo,” and then pasting the url to this page.
